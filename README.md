<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is for an art assignment in Keimyung University. In the course "Studio Mixx (2)", I was asked about my identity, and visualize it specially.
Being a developer and a programmer student for 4 years now, the best way to identify myself is about being a developer, not an artist.

I'm kind of an artist myself because being an artist is not about doing great art, it's about being enough stupid to continue. That's why I'm an artistic programmer.
